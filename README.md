# Image_classification
## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Politecnico di Milano 2022 - First Homework

In this homework we were required to classify species of plants which were divided into categories according to their species. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal was to predict the correct class label. We had two weeks to complete the homework and we were divided in groups of 3. The professors provided us the zipped dataset and we tested the models on a hidden test set on a platform called Codalab. The metric used to evaluate the models and to place the teams in the leadeboard was the total accuracy. Despite this, the main focus of the challenge was to gain confidence and experience with Neural Networks.__
We wrote a report to describe our developing process, the decisions and the solutions with which we came up.__
We got 5/5 points.
